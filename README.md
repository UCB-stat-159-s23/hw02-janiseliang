This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2023 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/site). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.
